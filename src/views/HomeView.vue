    <h2>Responsive Sidebar Example</h2>
    <p>This example uses media queries to transform the sidebar into a top navigation bar when the screen size is 700px or less.</p>
    <p>We have also added a media query for screens that are 400px or less, which will vertically stack and center the navigation links.</p>
    <h3>Resize the browser window to see the effect.</h3>
